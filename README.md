Before Project Work:

This project will be an imitation of the "Etch-A-Sketch" that we know all too well. Hopefully, with undertaking such a project, I will be able to demonstrate the skills that I've accrued with: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Furthermore, the project will test my knowledge on DOM manipulation; to which, I am very excited about!

After project work:

Whew! I followed along with what the Odin Project expected of me from this project, and the wording that they had was sort of vague. I feel like I have used a lot more of Javascript than I did of the other two that were aforementioned. Flexbox was actually quite the struggle (width and height values, in particular), but I then decided that I wanted the canvas to have a static width and height. Yet again, I've worked with Python before, so the flow of logic is quite comfortable to me; however, there were a few methods that I was not aware of. I'm glad to have the methods become a part of my repertoire! On to the next project!
